### Assignment Description
Activity monitor devices are used to take daily measurements of activities such as steps or changes in altitude. Data in this assignment is provided through a csv file, provided through a link on the assignment page. Data in the csv contains data collected at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data consists of 61 days of data collected in October and November of 2012.

The variables included in this dataset are:

steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as NA)
date: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format
interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken
The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there are a total of 17,568 observations in this dataset.
